# Resistor Color Code Generator

## Overview
The **Resistor Color Code Generator** is a web application that allows users to determine the resistor value based on color bands and vice versa. It is designed to be user-friendly and mobile-friendly, providing an intuitive interface for both novice and experienced electronics enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Input Resistor Value**: Users can input a resistor value (in ohms) to generate the corresponding color bands.
- **Select Color Bands**: Users can select four color bands (two significant figures, one multiplier, and one tolerance) to calculate the resistor value.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
- **Color Representation**: Displays selected colors as colored blocks alongside their names, enhancing the visual understanding of the color coding system.

## How to Use
1. **To Generate Color Code**:
   - Enter the desired resistor value in ohms in the provided input field.
   - Click the "Generate Color Code" button to see the corresponding color bands.

2. **To Calculate Resistor Value**:
   - Select the color bands from the dropdown menus for Band 1, Band 2, Multiplier, and Tolerance.
   - Click the "Generate Value" button to calculate and display the resistor value.

## Technology Stack
The application is built using the following technologies:
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for generating color codes and calculating resistor values.
